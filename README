This directory contains the following subdirectories:

	bin
	src/lib/sfio
	src/lib/sfdisc
	man/man3

You should set your PATH variable to contain the "bin" subdirectory.
This makes the program "iffe" available in your shell program path.
iffe (IF Features Exist) is a small language interpreter to
probe your local environment for various features required by the
being installed software. You may want to use it yourself to make
your code portable. The "features" subdirectories of some of the
above directories contain iffe probes for the respective packages.
After changing the PATH variable, you can move to the appropriate
subdirectory and run "make" to build the respective software.
If you run into any problems, give me a call.
Good luck and have fun.
